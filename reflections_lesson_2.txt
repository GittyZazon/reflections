To create a new repository in Git, use git init.

ls -a - list the files in a directory
git init - create new repository
git status - find out which files have changed since last commit
git add - add a file to the repository
git commit - creates a commit for the changes
cd .. - return to parent directory

1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, Git creates a new empty repository. This is needed to store a new directory of
files which you can then log commits into.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you can make changes to files before you add them to the repository for a final commit.
The directory is where the files are stored in a general sense, before being added to the repository on git. The
value of the staging area is that you don't have to commit every change you've ever made into the repository, just the
specific ones you make starting from a certain point.

3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

When a file is in the staging area you can use git diff to find out which changes have been made. This helps you to
make sure you don't overwhelm the commit with changes that aren't logically connected.
