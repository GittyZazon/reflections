1) How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

It helped because instead of tediously searching through over a thousand lines of code, I was able to see just where there were differences. The old version was running well, so now I can find what I changed to make it wrong.

Step one: Download the two files into a "Folder"
Step two: cd "Folder"
Step three: FC (file compare) old_version.js new_version.js
Step four: Find the bug!
